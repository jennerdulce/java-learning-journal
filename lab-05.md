# Linked Lists and Carrer Counseling

## Career Counseling

- Since I've graduated I've learned that graduating and getting a certificate is only a small piece of the bigger picture. You need to build yourself professionally and show that you really want it. A job is not just given to you, there are many things that Robin has presented with us that we need to work on, on top of graduating a bootcamp.

> KEY: Build up my brand and show that I am the one that companies want to hire
> OTHER KEY: Network working with friends probably the most important way to get into the industry, just make sure you're ready for the opportunity when its presented to you
