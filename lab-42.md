# OS and Ethics

- What went well, that I might forget if I donâ€™t write down?
  - https://www.firsttimersonly.com/
  - Refer to this website for a walkthrough on how to contribute to a open source as well as other websites to find places to contribute to

- What did I learn today?
  - I learned how to contribute to open source projects
  - We discussed ethics. The topic on ethics is very political and there are so many perspectives that arguments could go on until infinity.
  - It makes me see that people don't see eye to eye which cause conflicts.
  - I know myself and I am a good person. I know that the tech industry will overall benefit me, as I will prevent people from stepping over boundaries and speak up with I see things that are unethical in my workspace

- What should I do differently next time?
  - It's hard to not have a bias when it comes to ethics when I feel like the other side of the argument is just stupid.
  - I should have put more time into finding a better Open Source project, one that actually has value if I were to tell an interviewer about it

- What still puzzles me, or what do I need to learn more about?
  - Approaching some Open Source projects are intimidating. I honestly would not be sure where to even start if I were to contribute to a built out application thats thousands of pages long

- Is the assignment complete? If not, where exactly did you leave off, and what work remains?
  - Yes, this assignment is complete
