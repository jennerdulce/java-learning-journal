# Stacks and Queues

- I honestly love ideas like this and how this career promotes this kind of growth.

1. I finally understand generic variables and how T is used.. Whatever you put into the angled bracket, it will be passed down through each of the classes

2. I learned how to create a stack and queue using a Linked List. I build these data structures using a basic array in JavaScript

3. I really wish I was able to make it into lab times to be able to ask a few questions. I came across a few bugs in my code that I cannot figure out. I am sure that they are small problems

4. EXCEPTIONS EXCEPTIONS EXCEPTIONS. When to use them, How to use them effectively, How to test them. Use in conjunction with try catch.. I feel like I am very weak with exceptions at the moment
